With project downintheDM, we wanted to capitalise over Portia AI's ability to authenticate over websites and carry out tasks using their open-source and our own custom tools. Given the Portia AI SDK, we built a custom tool that authenticates a user's Instagram account provided the required credentials, that runs through the user's unread messages and produces a combined summary report of all the messages from various people. We provide the option of having the report sent to the user's email and Portia AI handles typing up the email as well!
This app is primarily for those users who want to avoid doomscrolling on reels and just want to keep up with their friends and family on instagram. 
Given more time, we would have created another custom tool for Portia AI to type up appropriate automated responses for the user's DMs and made the app more user friendly with a very simplistic UI that fits within the theme of reducing digital distractions.
