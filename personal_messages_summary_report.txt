To summarize the personal messages of authenticated users into a report, you would need to access the Instagram API or SDK provided by Instagram using the access token obtained during user authentication. This access token is used to authenticate users and obtain their personal messages. By following the authentication protocols set by Instagram, you can verify the user's identity and grant access to their account to retrieve and summarize their personal messages.
